# ChatApp_common_template

**The code in this repository is NOT intended to be used by itself!!**

***This repository is designed to be used as the submodule repository for the ChatApp project's "<code>common</code>" package. Do NOT work with this repository directly, only as a submodule.***

Use the cloning URL of this repository to add this repository as a submodule to your ChatApp project where the submodule is mapped to the <code>src/common</code> folder (= "submodule path" in Eclipse) in your ChatApp project. 

**Update the submodule VERY OFTEN to ensure that you are always working with the latest version of the shared code!**

*In your design group's page in Canvas, be sure to add a link back to this repo!*

## This repository is ONLY for the group's proposed *NETWORK* API interfaces and documentation

Implementation code for the individual teams' ChatApp application should NOT be included in this repository!

If the proposal includes optional "convenience" code, be sure to clearly isolate it in a sub-package of the <code>common</code> package.  The use of convenience code CANNOT be a required part of the API as the API needs to be implementation-independent.

*Note: Students outside of the design group for this repository do NOT have access to this repository.  All public documentation must be done in Canvas.   Documentation included in this repo is for internal group use only.*
