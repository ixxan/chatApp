# RMIUtils
Utilities for RMI

Utilities for managing RMI plus the declarations of shared RMI-related constants.  

Students should use the utilities defined here to perform RMI-related management operations.  All system MUST utilize the constants defined here.

This package also contains the "<code>server.policy</code>" file needed to initialize RMI's security manager. 

**The working directory for the application MUST be set to the <code>bin</code> folder for these utilities to work properly!!**

* A "security manager* error is almost always due to the working directory not being set properly.
